# design-patterns
the design pattern notes im taking for the soft2201 class. i might expand this to be all of the code covered in soft2201

unlike my other repos these are not in order of when they were taught, its just going to be sorted by the kind of design smell

The participants are just the classes that are inside of the class. the ones that are using the design pattern
