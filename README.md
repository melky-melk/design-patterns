# design-patterns
the design pattern notes im taking for the soft2201 class. i might expand this to be all of the code covered in soft2201

unlike my other repos these are not in order of when they were taught, its just going to be sorted by the kind of design smell

The participants are just the classes that are inside of the class. the ones that are using the design pattern

For UML arrows just look at this website
https://www.gleek.io/blog/class-diagram-arrows.html

also make sure to turn off any code highlighting or squiggly lines, as all of the python files are just pseudocode ripped from refactor guru.
Dont expect any of the code to actually run...

good to check out https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/
